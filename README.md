# Dynamic News System

This project implements a dynamic news system where each news article is stored in a separate markdown file, organized by date.

## News File Structure

```
src/content/news/
├── 2025-01-15-aramco-prequalified.md
├── 2024-12-10-successful-field-trial.md
├── 2024-12-05-aramco-leadership-visit.md
└── 2024-11-20-new-research-facility.md
```

## File Naming Convention

News files should be named using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

- `YYYY-MM-DD`: The publication date
- `slug`: A URL-friendly identifier (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces)

## Markdown File Format

Each news file should start with YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content:

```markdown

title: "Article Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
category: "Category Name"
image: "https://image-url.com/image.jpg"
